Repository for my BA thesis focusing on hate speech detection. The goal is to create an automatic tool that detects hateful text english, spanish and greek.

Data: We use texts retrieved from Twitter. Following a multi-lingual approach, we use an english, a spanish and a greek dataset. The user is asked to choose among the three languages by typing "english", "spanish" or "greek".
Both the spanish and the greek dataset have two labels; "hateful" and "neutral". The english dataset has a third "offensive" label, which indicates a sentiment between hate and neutral.
